# cholesky-solve[WIP]

This module solves sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems,
by finding the Cholesky decomposition(the `LDL^T` decomposition, and not
the `LL^T` decomposition), and then doing forward substitution and
backward substitution. It is basically a Javascript port of the paper
"Algorithm 8xx: a concise sparse Cholesky factorization package". This
kind of solver has many applications in digital geometry processing.

## Install

    npm install cholesky-solve

## Example

```javascript
var choleskySolve = require('cholesky-solve')

// matrix dimension.
const n = 10

// sparse matrix on left-hand side
var M = [
  [2, 2, 1.5],
  [1, 1, 1.0],
  [1, 4, 0.02],
  [5, 5, 1.2],
  [7, 7, 1.6],
  [4, 4, 2.6],
  [3, 3, 1.1],
  [4, 7, 0.09],
  [4, 6, 0.16],
  [0, 0, 1.7],
  [4, 8, 0.52],
  [0, 8, 0.13],
  [6, 6, 1.3],
  [7, 8, 0.11],
  [4, 9, 0.53],
  [8, 8, 1.4],
  [9, 9, 3.1],
  [1, 9, 0.01],
  [6, 9, 0.56]
]

// right-hand side
var b = [0.287, 0.22, 0.45, 0.44, 2.486, 0.72, 1.55, 1.424, 1.621, 3.759]

var P = require('cuthill-mckee')(M, n)

// finally, solve the equation
// Mx = b
// and print x

// the `prepare` method returns a function that can be used to solve
// the equation for any value of b.
var solve = choleskySolve.prepare(M, n, P)
console.log(solve(b))
```

## API

### `require("cholesky-solve").prepare(M, n, [P])`

Decomposes `M` into the Cholesky decomposition of the form `LDL^T`. A
function is returned that can be used to solve the equation `Mx = b`,
for some given value of `b`.

* `M` a list of the matrix coefficients of the sparse matrix `M`.
* `n` the dimension of the matrix `M`
* `P` encodes a permutation matrix that preconditions `M` before the Cholesky decomposition is solved for. A possible algorithm for finding a good permutation is
[Cuthillâ€“McKee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthill%E2%80%93McKee_algorithm). See
the module [cuthill-mckee](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/cuthill-mckee) for a
Javascript implementation.

**Returns** A function that takes a single argument `b`. The function
  returns the solution to the equation `Mx = b`, encoded as a simple array.
