# cholesky-solve[WIP]

This module solves sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems,
by finding the Cholesky decomposition(the `LDL^T` decomposition, and not
the `LL^T` decomposition), and then doing forward substitution and
backward substitution. It is basically a Javascript port of the paper
"Algorithm 8xx: a concise sparse Cholesky factorization package". This
kind of solver has many applications in digital geometry processing.

## Install

    npm install cholesky-solve

## Example

```javascript
var choleskySolve = require('cholesky-solve')

// matrix dimension.
const n = 10

/*
Below we specify the sparse matrix:

1.7  0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0.13 0
0    1.0  0    0    0.02 0    0    0    0    0.01
0    0    1.5  0    0    0    0    0    0    0
0    0    0    1.1  0    0    0    0    0    0
0    0.02 0    0    2.6  0    0.16 0.09 0.52 0.53
0    0    0    0    0    1.2  0    0    0    0
0    0    0    0    0.16 0    1.3  0    0    0.56
0    0    0    0    0.09 0    0    1.6  0.11 0
0.13 0    0    0    0.52 0    0    0.11 1.4  0
0    0.01 0    0    0.53 0    0.56 0    0    3.1

Note that we only specify the coefficients on the diagonal, 
or above the diagonal. Since the matrix is symmetric,
specifying the coefficients below the diagonal is completely redundant. 
Finally, the order in which the coefficients is specified in is not important.

## API

### `require("cholesky-solve").prepare(M, n, [P])`

Decomposes `M` into the Cholesky decomposition of the form `LDL^T`. A
function is returned that can be used to solve the equation `Mx = b`,
for some given value of `b`.

* `M` a list of the matrix coefficients of the sparse matrix `M`. These are
the coefficients on the diagonal and above the diagonal. The ones below the
diagonal do not need to be specified, since the matrix is symmetric. 
* `n` the dimension of the matrix `M`
* `P` encodes a permutation matrix that preconditions `M` before the Cholesky decomposition is solved for. A possible algorithm for finding a good permutation is
[Cuthillâ€“McKee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthill%E2%80%93McKee_algorithm). See
the module [cuthill-mckee](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/cuthill-mckee) for a
Javascript implementation.

**Returns** A function that takes a single argument `b`. The function
  returns the solution to the equation `Mx = b`, encoded as a simple array.
